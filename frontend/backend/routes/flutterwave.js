const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Sample route
router.post('/create-account', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Flutterwave account created!');
});

module.exports = router;
// This code sets up a basic Express route for creating a Flutterwave account. It imports the necessary modules, defines a POST route for account creation, and exports the router for use in the main application file. You can expand this with actual Flutterwave API integration as needed.
