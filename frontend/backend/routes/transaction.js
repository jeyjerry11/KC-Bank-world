// This code sets up the routes for handling transactions within the banking application. It includes routes for sending money, fetching a user's transaction history, checking balance, and verifying transactions. The router is exported for use in the main application file, allowing for organized and modular handling of transaction-related requests.
// The `sendMoney` function handles the logic for sending money between users, while `getTransactions` retrieves the transaction history for a specific user. The `getBalance` function checks the user's current balance, and the `verifyTransaction` function is used to verify the status of a specific transaction by its ID. The `/all` route fetches all transactions, providing a comprehensive view of all transaction activities within the application.
// This modular approach allows for better organization and maintainability of the code, making it easier to manage different aspects of the banking application.
// The use of Express Router helps in defining routes in a clean and structured manner, allowing for easy expansion and modification of the application's routing logic in the future.
// The code is ready to be integrated into the main application file, where it can be mounted on a specific path (e.g., `/api/transaction`) to handle requests related to transactions within the banking application.
// This setup is essential for building a robust banking application that can handle various transaction types and user interactions efficiently.
// The routes defined here are crucial for the transaction functionality of the banking application, allowing users to interact with their accounts and perform necessary financial operations seamlessly.
